# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This repo contains the run_analysis.R script, Codebook, and a README file.

The run_analysis.R script executes the following 5 steps:

1.  Merges downloaded training and test data sets into a single data set.
2.  Extracts only measurements for mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.  Adds descriptive names to the data set.
4.  Labels data set with descriptive variable names.
5.  Outputs a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and subject.
